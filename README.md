# Check-In
Check-In is an ongoing project for taking attendence using location based APIs. Inspired by [Arkaive](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arkaive.arkaive&hl=en_US), Check-In takes advantage of the GeoFencing Android API to restrict student check-in within a geographic proximity. The project is currently in a prototype phase and we welcome anyone contributors!
